(node:25750) ExperimentalWarning: Type Stripping is an experimental feature and might change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
(node:25750) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/jhhyun/Desktop/Develop/project/notion2pdf/src/server/notion2pdf.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/jhhyun/Desktop/Develop/project/notion2pdf/package.json.
